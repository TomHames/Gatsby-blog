# Gatsby Blog with Netlify ðŸš€

This site is using [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a blazing-fast modern site generator for React, and is deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects.

It is based off the [Lumen v2](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen) starter template, which is a minimal, lightweight and mobile-first starter for creating blogs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment notes below for informaton on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Install :computer:

#### 1. Install the Gatsby CLI

    npm i -g gatsby-cli

#### 2. Create Gatsby site from Gatsby starter

    // using default template
    gatsby new <gatsby-starter-name>

    // using lumen template
    gatsby new lumen https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen

#### 3. Start site in `develop` mode

    cd <gatsby-starter-name>
    gatsby develop

#### 4. Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000.

Open the `<gatsby-start-name>` directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

## Deploy with Netlify :dizzy: 

Netlify CMS can run in any frontend web environment, but the quickest way to try it out is by running it on a pre-configured starter site with Netlify. Use the button below to build and deploy your own copy of the repository:

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify"></a>

*Please note: the above button will allow you to deploy your site using the [Lumen v2](https://github.com/GatsbyCentral/gatsby-v2-starter-lumen) template.*

After clicking that button, youâ€™ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete. Next, youâ€™ll need to set up Netlifyâ€™s Identity service to authorize users to log in to the CMS.
