My name is Tom and I'm a Software Development Engineer for Capital One. Welcome to my first ever blog! 

This blog will be about a few things... 

Firstly, I want to write about my journey as a self-taught developer. Coming from an entirely unrelated profession, I have a unique journey into tech. I want to map my journey from the *why* to the *where* and the *how*, in the hope that you find what I write interesting and even, I hope, inspiring. 

Secondly, I want to use this blog as a learning platform, for both me and you. Being self-taught and completely new to tech, I have a *lot* to learn. The sheer volume of knowledge one has to learn as a noob is rather overwhelming. To counter this I want to use this blog to demonstrate my compentency. I believe "the best way to learn is to teach" and to teach as simply as possible. I hope you find value in this. 

And finally, scattered amongst the posts about my journey and educational posts as I further my learning, you may stumble across the occasional post about things I enjoy doing in my spare time.

I hope you enjoy...
