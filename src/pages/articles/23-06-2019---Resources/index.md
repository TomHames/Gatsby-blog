In this post, I want to share with you some of the resources I have found most useful when learning how to code. Due to the vast amount of resources available, it is important to limit yourself to a select few that work for you. 

###Codecademy

If you simply type 'how to learn to code' into Google, one of the first links you'll come across is [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). Codecademy was the first website I started with. It did a fantastic job of introducing me to HTML and CSS. Their inbuilt text editor with automatic preview were great in providing me with realtime feedback and changes to my code. Seeing changes occur right in front of my eyes was both very satisfying and great for demonstrating how the changes to my code reflected changes to the structure or styling of a webpage. The tutorials helped me "dip my toes in the water" of web development. It esssentially helped provide me of a good overview of how a webpage is constructed.

###freeCodeCamp

After I felt I had a good grasp on HTML and CSS, it is natural to progress to learn the basics of JavaScript. I used freeCodeCamp, a non-profit organisation, to learn how to 'properly' code. Properly being that HTML and CSS are Markdown and Styling lanuages, respectively. They are not a Programming lanuguage i.e. they cannot write instructions through code to a computer in order for the computer to perform actions.

This is where I talk about how amazing freeCodeCamp is. I would estimate that 70% of my learning came from freeCodeCamp.

Firstly, interactive learning.

Secondly, huge topics broken down into small digestible pieces.

Thirdly, projects to consolidate learning, demonstrate skills, and gain motivation.

Finally, the community - Forums, Reddit, YouTube, Medium, Podcasts etc.

##Team Treehouse

This is the ONLY website I actually paid for. And there is a reason for this.

The content and videos Team Treehouse produce are exceptional quality. Check out the following vid to see: INSERT VID LINK. They also do a fantastic job at helping their user's retain the information learnt. For example, there are interactive quizzes and challenges throughout the tutorials.

###YouTube

Below are my top 3 channels I found most helpful in learning new topics or supplementing my learning from elsewhere:

+ Traversy Media
+ freeCodeCamp
+ Havard's CS50
