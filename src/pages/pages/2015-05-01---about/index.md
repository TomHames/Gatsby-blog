**Hi, I'm Tom!** 👋

I'm a self-taught Software Development Engineer working for Capital One UK. Prior to this I worked as a Physiotherapist.

In 2018 I made the decision to change career and began teaching myself how to code. I began teaching myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript and practiced what I had learnt by creating some simple web apps.

In 2019 I was offered my very first job in tech. I now work as a Software Engineer in Web using technologies such as React, Node.js and AWS.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, playing football, and spending time with my wonderful fiancée, daughter and dog (Ralph the Pug! 🐶).
