Hi, I'm Tom! üëã

I'm a 28 y/o self-taught Software Development Engineer. I currently work for Capital One based in Nottingham, UK. Prior to this I worked as a Physiotherapist for 7 years since qualifying from university. 

At the start of 2018, I made the decision to change career and began teaching myself how to code in my spare time. I started with HTML and CSS before naturally progressing to learning the basics of JavaScript. I practiced what I had learnt by creating some simple web apps along the way, which you can checkout on my GitHub. In Feb 2019, I was offered my very first job in tech. I currently work in Web Dev using technologies such as React, Node.js and AWS.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books, playing football, and spending time with my wonderful fianc√©e, daughter and dog (Ralph the Pug! üê∂).
